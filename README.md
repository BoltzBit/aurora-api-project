## Why Aurora?
The name Aurora came from the natural event called Aurora Borealis. It is a scientific event described by the interaction between the earth's magnetic layer and energized particles from the solar wind.

A curiosity about such an event is that what we see in photographs is not always the same image that is seen live.
